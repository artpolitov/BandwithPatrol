Whew,Whew,Whew! Do You Hear That? It's The Internet Usage Patrol! This nifty tool helps monitor usage over a month. It's been tested in Ubuntu, and Linux Mint. 

This project was written primarily in Python and can easily be installed by downloading and running the installer.sh script included.

For best results, restarting is required after installation.


These are the following commands available:
Eusage -h            : for help
Eusage -r            : for resetting
Eusage -c            : for changing the free usage time and auto reset date
Eusage -H month year :(both in digits) for getting usage history of given month in a specified year
